Talk about a match made in baking heaven. 
I am a big fan of dense cakes and boy does oat flour deliver on a **dense** crumb.

Oat flour is gluten free and a (roughly) 1 to 1 flour substitute for baked goods that do not need gluten, e.g. fruit breads. 
Recently an ovo vegetarian, I have been on a mission to recreate all my favorite baked goods without dairy and with as many unprocessed natural ingredients as possible. My parents and sister are gluten free, so I eliminating gluten from baked goods makes it easier for me to share the goodies.

To get the sweetness into the oat flour breads (let's be honest though, they're just fruit cakes) without using sugar, fruits, coconut, and natural sweeteners like honey and maple syrup work wonders! You don't need as much maple syrup or honey as sugar. In fact, I only use about half as much, but I also don't like my breads over sweet. 

The oats offer a bit of a sweet earthy flavor. Coconut butter (shredded coconut meat) helps a bit with added sweetness.

Great dairy free, oat based recipes
 - apple muffins
 - banana bread 
 - zucchini bread 
 - sugar cookies 
 - waffles 
 - pancakes 
 - edible cookie dough (Okay, this isn't dairy free or sugar free, but come on. Sugar and chocolate is a very enticing combo...)
